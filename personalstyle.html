	Coding coding code code. I kinda wish we could've done more with python or java, I enjoyed making projects a lot. Web design has been decently fun but still, not as fun as making functioning projects. <br>
	I mean don't get me wrong, this is useful to know or whatever, and it's not particularly difficult. I just wish it moved more quickly and clearly. Very slow paced, I feel like I'm wasting time. <br>
	In any case, I'm glad I'm at least learning it. <br>
	Well now I don't know what to write about at all so I'm just going to write whatever. <br>
	I'm pretty excited to be going to Georgia Tech, its ranked in the top five of the U.S. for computer science so that seems cool. Hopefully I land a nice job after graduation, I just want money. I've heard that it's pretty normal to land a 100k salary a month or two after graduation so I think I'm set up for a good future. <br>
	Aside from that, I've been working on a lot of scholarship applications recently. I need to figure out ways to pay for college, especially if I don't get the Gates Scholarship. I'm really hopeful about it but I don't want to put all my eggs into one basket, so I'm trying to get as many other scholarships as possible (wish me luck). I won a $500 scholarship a few days ago which I'm really happy about. The Whitetails Unlimited one, one student per Paulding County School gets it apparently. I told my mom and she was really proud of me for it. She told me to get more lol. <br>
	But yeah, that's about all I can think of for now. I'm gonna just keep doing scholarship applications until college is affordable for me. Hopefully everything works out.

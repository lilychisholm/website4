	<h1> Website woohoo</h1>
	<h2> Well, it's a website.</h2>
	<p> In case you didn't know, here is a website. It's for an assignment, and I just started learning this so it's a bit plain. <br>
		Of course, I <em> do </em> know <em> some </em> code, particularly SQL, Python, and some Java, but I've never really worked with <strong>HTML.</strong> <br>
		I'm not really sure what to write for this. It's pretty cool so far though I guess. I'm having fun with it. The rest of the asignment says I also have to include some lists so I guess I'll do that now.
	</p>
	<h2>Ordered List (yipee)</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>abracadabra </li>
		<li>abracadabr</li>
		<li>abracadab</li>
		<li>abracada</li>
		<li>abracad</li>
		<li>abraca</li>
		<li>abrac</li>
		<li>abra</li>
		<li>abr</li>
		<li>ab</li>
		<li>a</li>
		
	</ol>
	<h2>Unordered List!! (holy moly)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>eenie</li>
		<li>meenie</li>
		<li>miney</li>
		<li>mo</li>

		<li>eenie</li>
		<li>meenie</li>
		<li>miney</li>
		<li>mo</li>
		
		
	</ul>
	<h2>epic conclusion</h2>
		<p>And there you go folks!! My little website, completed in about ten minutes. I <em>think</em> I met all the requirements (I sincerely hope so), and now I'm off to do something else.<br> <strong>wahooooo!!!</strong>  </p>
